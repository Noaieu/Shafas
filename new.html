          On this Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.in my monochrome world
          ,you are the most colorful thing i ever saw. i will never forget
          the moment i realized i loved you, i love your smile, and 
          how you can make me smile, i love the way you laugh, talk, and
          well pretty much everything about you, aku ga pernah nyangka
          aku bakal nulis ini tapii.. when it comes to love it's not always about
          how you feel about that person; it's about how that person
          makes you feel about yourself. "you make me feel like me"
          Happy Valentine, my sweetheart. Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
